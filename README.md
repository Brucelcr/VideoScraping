# VideoScraping

Automated and batch scraping of videos and information from Bilibili (China's equivalent of YouTube) using keywords. You can also scrape content directly from a specific user's homepage.

# Why did I write this program?

I wrote this program because I needed a large number of videos for AI translation testing. I found that there weren’t any existing scripts online that could automatically and batch-scrape Bilibili videos. So, I decided to write one myself and share it, so others can use it in the future. Bilibili offers individual video downloads, but it doesn’t support batch downloads, which is also the limitation of most scripts available online.

# How does this script work, and what is the principle behind it?
